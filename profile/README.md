# 🌞 Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA)

Welcome to the **Owens Valley Solar Array (OVSA)** project repository — a collection for solar radio astronomy research, data analysis, and instrumentation development based at the **Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO)**.

## 🔭 Overview

The Owens Valley Solar Array is dedicated to observing and understanding solar activity through high-precision radio imaging and spectroscopy. Our work combines data from two key instruments located at OVRO:

- **EOVSA (Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array):**  
  A solar-dedicated radio interferometer designed to image the Sun in microwave frequencies (1–18 GHz). EOVSA provides insights into solar flares, coronal magnetic fields, and energetic particle acceleration.

- **OVRO-LWA (Owens Valley Radio Observatory – Long Wavelength Array):**  
  A low-frequency (10–88 MHz) array for wide-field solar and space weather monitoring. OVRO-LWA complements EOVSA by probing the Sun’s extended corona and solar radio bursts at longer wavelengths.
